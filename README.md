Triangles 
You will be given 3 integers, the length of 3 lines and you will have to decide whether these 3 lines can form a triangle or not? If they cannot form a triangle print "NO", otherwise print "YES", followed by the kind of triangle they will form, acute, right or obtuse-angled triangle, on the next line.
Input Format: The first line of input is a single integer n, the number of test cases. Next, n lines contain 3 integers a, b and c. The length of the 3 lines. 
Output Format: Mentioned above. *Note* that each word is printed on sepatare line.  Sample Testcases:  Testcase 1: Input -  2 3 4 5 1 2 3 Output -  YES Right NO  Testcase 2: Input -  3 2 4 6 6 7 8 11 10 22 Output -  NO YES Acute NO  
Explanation for Testcase 1: In the first test, sides 3,4 and 5 will form a Right-angled triangle, so we will print "YES", followed by "Right" on the next line. And in the second test, sides 1,2, and 3 cannot form a triangle, so we simply print "NO", on the next line.
